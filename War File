War

To start you are going to need to get a full deck of 52 cards and 2 players;
You are going to get the full deck, shuffle randomly, and then split it in half and give one stack to each player;
Keep the decks hidden from the player holding as well as the other player;
Donâ€™t order the cards nor move them from their dealt position of face down;
Each player turns up the top card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards;
The winner puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack;
Continue playing until one player runs out cards in his pile then the other players;
Take out jacks
Ace = 14, king = 13, queen = 12, jack = 11, other cards are their numeric value
