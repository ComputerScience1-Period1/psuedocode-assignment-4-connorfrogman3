War

To start you are going to need to get a full deck of 52 cards and 2 players;
You are going to get the full deck, shuffle randomly, and then split it in half and give one stack to each player;
Keep the decks hidden from the player holding as well as the other player;
Donâ€™t order the cards nor move them from their dealt position of face down;
Each player turns up the top card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards;
The winner puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack;
Continue playing until one player runs out cards in his pile then the other players;

Rules

If the cards flipped are equal in value then each player flips another card face down, as well as another card face
Up;
 Whoever has the higher card that player takes all of the cars and put them on the bottom of their pile;
If the new cards are equal repeat the previous maneuver;
Repeat until one player flips over a greater card than the other player;

First of all you only wrote down the rules on how to play the card game and didn't even put in 
of your own psuedocode down. I'm going to show how you would start your code if you were to do
it.

while (player has > 0 cards) {
 both players put down one card from their hand
  if player one's card is larger than player two's card
   player one takes his card and other card and put it at the bottom of player one's deck
}

TO DO LIST:
The rest of the code.
